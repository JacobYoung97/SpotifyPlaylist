## My additions
While this may be based off of someone else's project, I plan on adding more to the basic application.

This would consist of:

* Checking all the user's playlists (the ones they have made)
* Going through EVERY video in liked videos or a specified YouTube playlist (defaults to the first 5 listed naturally)
* Adding the ability to give the Spotify playlist a name, description, and if it is public or not (original had default values)
